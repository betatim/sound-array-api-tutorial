# Tutorial: learning array API with sound

This is a tutorial in which you will learn about the [array API](https://data-apis.org/array-api/latest/).
It uses sound and sound effects as examples to illustrate how to write code
that works with array inputs from array API compatible libraries such as
Numpy, CuPy, PyTorch, etc.

The target audience are people who want to write libraries or code that is agnostic
to the type of the input arrays.


## Notebooks

You should be able to run the notebooks for this tutorial on Google's Colab.
We recommend using it because it has (almost all) the required libraries and
it gives you access to a CUDA GPU.
